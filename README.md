# AndurilCards

Wallet reference cards for the Anduril firmware for flashlights

I previously released similar cards in a printable PDF format. This is my attempt at releasing the cards in a LaTeX format so people can directly modify the cards.

If you suggest edits or updates to the TEX code please ensure it formats correctly as a PDF first. Other suggestions are welcome for implementation as issues.

## Using the cards
The cards use a similar notation to other instructional material for navigating the firmware.
- C indicates clicks
- eg. 3C indicated 3 clicks in quick succession
- H indicates a hold
- eg. 3H indicated 3 clicks in quick succession with the third click being held

These cards are not intended as a comprehensive guide to the firmware but as a card sized quick reference. Use requires some knowledge of the functions of the firmware and the flashlight it is installed on.
